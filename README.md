# FDNS User Interface Library for React
This repository contains a front-end library built in React. The library is designed to help developers efficiently build user interfaces on top of the Foundation Services. The library is **pre-release software** and being made public to gain feedback from the open source community.

## Running locally
Carefully read the following instructions on how to run and test this library in your local environment.

## Dependencies

### Before you start
You will need to have the following software installed to run this library locally:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Windows Users**: Please use [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for running the commands in this README

## Basic Usage
Create your project with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```sh
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install --save fdns-ui-react
```

Open up `src/App.js` in your text editor of choice and include the React components:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { SuperGrid, fixtures } from 'fdns-ui-react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

// grab some test fixtures
const { headers, messages } = fixtures;

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <SuperGrid data={messages} headers={headers} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Start your project:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser and view your Grid. You can now add any components in the library into your application.

## Development/StyleGuidist

This library currently uses [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) to document and view examples of the various components.

To view the StyleGuide, after running `npm i`, use the command:

```sh
npm start
```

or `npx styleguidist server`. This will run the styleguide on `http://localhost:6060/`.
