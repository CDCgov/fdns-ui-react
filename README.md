# FDNS User Interface Library for React
This repository contains a front-end library built in React. The library is designed to help developers efficiently build user interfaces on top of the Foundation Services. The library is **pre-release software** and being made public to gain feedback from the open source community.

## Running locally
Carefully read the following instructions on how to run and test this library in your local environment.

## Dependencies

### Before you start
You will need to have the following software installed to run this library locally:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Windows Users**: Please use [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for running the commands in this README

### FontAwesome
Note that this app uses the free version of FontAwesome v5, specifically [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) for most of its icons. Many icons have changed in syntax slightly since v4, so be sure to check against the [new FA icon gallery](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

You can add a new FontAwesomeIcon to your component by first importing the React component:

    import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';

Then you will have available `FontAwesomeIcon` (the icon name is from the base and does not include `fa fa-` like in previous versions of FA):

    <FontAwesomeIcon icon='file-code' />

Both the `fas` (Solid, default) and `far` (Regular) icons have been added to the library. If you need to add a Regular icon (`-o` in v4), you must add in that style such as:

    <FontAwesomeIcon icon={['far' ,'file-code']} />

Reference the docs for further details about what all can be done with this lib.

## Basic Usage
Create your project with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```sh
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install --save fdns-ui-react
```

Open up `src/App.js` in your text editor of choice and include the React components:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { SuperGrid, fixtures } from 'fdns-ui-react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

// grab some test fixtures
const { headers, messages } = fixtures;

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <SuperGrid data={messages} headers={headers} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Start your project:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser and view your Grid. You can now add any components in the library into your application.

## Development

If you wish to add or test this library, the best way currently is to utilize the [fdns-ui-react-docs](https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ui-react-docs) app and run it in dev mode adjacent to this repo before linking it with npm. You can then run this app in dev mode (`npm run dev`) which will run `watch` and update the docs app as you change this library. Make sure to read the instructions in the docs library as well.

If you get a `Multiple copies of React loaded` error (this will often happen when you do a new `npm i` on this library or on the docs app), you will need to run `npm run link` in the docs library again to resolve this issue.
